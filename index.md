## About

I am a technologist, surfer of waves, and a proud father of three. I love building things that matter, working with healthy teams, and surprising & delighting the world with the result.

As a customer facing engineer, I possess a natural ease and comfort working with prospects and customers who are technical experts in their respective domains. I succinctly translate highly technical products and capabilities to managers and procurement executives. I enjoy being an ambassador for the company at conferences and workshops. I’ve been told I possess an uncanny patience with the many moods of customers.
